# Healthcare-Analytics-Project

## **Introduction** 
This project explores trends in the healthcare sector. By collecting, analyzing, and evaluating healthcare data, it aims to obtain actionable insights and inform decision-making to improve patient care, enhance operational efficiency, and drive organizational performance. The analysis includes demographic information, medical conditions, treatment medications, and billing data to identify disease trends. The study utilizes Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL for database management, and Tableau for interactive dashboards to extract valuable insights.

## **Business Objectives**  
The purpose of this project is to help healthcare organizations improve patient care and financial efficiency.

#### **Demographic Insights**  
Identify the distribution of male and female patients, as well as medical symptoms across different age groups. Assess the impact of medical conditions based on gender and age demographics.

#### **Treatment Patterns and Care Management**  
Analyze the most common medical conditions to determine the most frequently prescribed medications. Evaluate the average age of patients each year and examine differences in care management between younger and older patients.

#### **Healthcare Financial Analysis**  
Analyze the costs associated with different medical conditions and billing patterns. Assess annual healthcare expenditure trends to identify which medical categories require the highest expenses.

#### **Predictive Insights for Medical Resource Allocation**  
Understand the yearly trends in medical conditions and analyze the relationship between medical diseases and patient blood types. Since blood contains different antigens and antibodies, routine blood tests can help detect certain blood disorders or immune system diseases.

#### **Healthcare Strategy Optimization**  
Evaluate which medical conditions impact specific age groups the most through data analysis. Optimize care strategies to improve patient outcomes. Develop and strengthen care management systems to enhance hospital treatment processes while ensuring financial sustainability through data-driven decision-making.
